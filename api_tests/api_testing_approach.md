## API Testing Approach

## 1. Objectives
The objective of API testing is to ensure that the PATCH endpoint behaves as expected under various conditions. This includes validating functionality, error handling, boundary conditions, performance, and security.

## 2. Key Testing Areas
Functional Testing
- Verify that the API accepts valid requests and processes updates correctly.
- Ensure the API responds with the correct status codes and updated data.
Validation and Error Handling
- Test the API's behavior when invalid or incomplete data is provided.
- Validate the error codes and messages returned for incorrect requests.
Boundary Testing
- Assess the API's ability to handle large payloads or extreme input sizes.
- Test with the maximum allowable field lengths and nested data structures.
Security Testing
- Check for vulnerabilities such as injection attacks, unauthorized updates, and improper data exposure.
- Validate authentication and authorization mechanisms (if applicable).
Exploratory Testing
- Test edge cases and real-world scenarios not explicitly outlined in the API documentation.
- Simulate unexpected or malicious input to identify weaknesses.

## 3. Test Scenarios
## Positive Test Scenarios
1. Valid Request:
   - Send a PATCH request with a valid ID and payload.
   - Verify that the response contains the updated data.
2. Partial Update:
   - Update only a subset of fields while leaving others unchanged.
   - Confirm that unspecified fields retain their original values.

## Negative Test Scenarios
1. Invalid ID:
   - Use non-existent, malformed, or special-character IDs (e.g., "invalid_id", "!@#$%^&*()").
   - Ensure the API returns a `404 Not Found` or appropriate error response.
2. Empty Payload:
   - Send an empty JSON object (`{}`) as the payload.
   - Validate that the API returns a `400 Bad Request` or `404 Not Found`.
3. Invalid Fields:
   - Include unrecognized or unsupported fields in the payload (e.g., `{"invalid_field": "Invalid Value"}`).
   - Ensure the API returns a `400 Bad Request` or ignores invalid fields.
4. Incorrect Data Types:
   - Provide fields with invalid data types (e.g., a list instead of a string for the `name` field).
   - Verify that the API returns a `400 Bad Request`.
5. Special Characters:
   - Use payloads or IDs containing special characters to test for potential injection vulnerabilities.

## Boundary Test Scenarios
1. Maximum Field Lengths:
   - Test with the maximum allowable length for text fields to ensure proper handling.
2. Nested Payloads:
   - Use deeply nested JSON structures to validate the API's ability to handle complex data.
3. Large Payloads:
   - Gradually increase the payload size to determine the API's capacity and identify any breaking points.

## Security Test Scenarios
1. Injection Attacks:
   - Attempt SQL, JSON, or XML injection attacks within the payload.
2. Unauthorized Updates:
   - Simulate requests without authentication tokens or with incorrect permissions.
3. Data Exposure:
   - Verify that sensitive data (e.g., system metadata) is not exposed in the response.

## Exploratory Testing Scenarios
1. Unexpected HTTP Methods:
   - Test the PATCH endpoint using GET, POST, or DELETE to validate proper method restrictions.
2. Rapid Consecutive Updates:
   - Send multiple PATCH requests in quick succession to test for race conditions or state inconsistencies.
3. Conflicting Fields:
   - Update fields with conflicting values to assess API behavior.
4. Deprecated API Versions:
   - Attempt to use older or deprecated versions of the API (if applicable).
5. Chained Requests:
   - Make a PATCH request followed by other operations (e.g., GET, DELETE) to ensure state consistency
